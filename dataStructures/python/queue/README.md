# Queue

A queue is similar to a stack, but defines a different way to add and remove elements.
The elements are inserted from one end, called the **rear**, and deleted from the other end, called the **front**.

This behavior is called **FIFO** (First In First Out).

The process of adding new elements into the queue is called **enqueue**.
The process of removing elements from the queue is called **dequeue**.
