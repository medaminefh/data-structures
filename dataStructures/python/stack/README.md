# Stack

A stack is a simple data structure that adds and removes elements in a particular order.

Every time an element is added, it goes on the **top** of the stack. Only element of the top stack can be removed.

Just like a stack of plates. This behavior is called **LIFO** (Last in First out)

Adding a new element onto the stack is called **push**.

Remove an element from the stack is called **pop**.
