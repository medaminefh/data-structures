# Linked List

A Linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node stores its own data and a link to the next node.

One Node links to another forming what can be thought of as a linked chain.

The 1st Node called the **Head**, and its used as the starting point for any iteration through the list.

The last Node must have its link pointing ti **None** to determine the end of the list.

Unlike Stacks and queues, you can insert and remove nodes in any position of the linked list.
