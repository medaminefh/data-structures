# Python Package

### A package is a container that contains various functions to perform specific tasks. For example, the math package includes the sqrt() function to perform the square root of a number.

### While working on big projects, we have to deal with a large amount of code, and writing everything together in the same file will make our code look messy. Instead, we can separate our code into multiple files by keeping the related code together in packages.

### Now, we can use the package whenever we need it in our projects. This way we can also reuse our code.

## Note:

### A directory must contain a file named `__init__.py` in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.
